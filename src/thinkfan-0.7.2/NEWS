thinkfan 0.7
============

1) Correction Values
--------------------
Temperatures that are perfectly fine for your CPU may already be dangerous for
most hard disks.

For simplicity's sake, thinkfan uses only the highest temperature found in the
system, but that'll most likely never be your harddisk. Thus you can now
specify a correction value for any sensor. This value is added to the actual
temperature and can be used to give that sensor a greater chance of being
considered in the fan speed decision.
I know this is quite unintuitive, but it's the least intrusive way of handling
this (for now). In a later release, I might extend the config syntax to allow
for sensor-specific temperature limits.

So please do check out the updated README and example configs, and modify your
config to save your harddisk from premature death. :-/

2) Config Syntax
----------------
Thinkfan now has a shiny new (as in cheesy, but better than scanf) parser for
the config files. It was actually already used in 0.6.5. However in this
release it was changed to be much tighter on the config syntax. In all
previous releases, it just skipped anything it didn't reconize. You could thus
have arbitrary garbage in your config file and thinkfan would just ignore it.
These times are over. Thinkfan now rejects anything that isn't a proper
statement or a comment. You can get the old behaviour back by using the -D
(DANGEROUS) option.
