		* tf_system.c: Save old PWM value in init_fan_sysfs() for restoring

		setting the fan level, to deal with hwmon drivers resetting fan
		control after a suspend/resume cycle.
		* README: adapt to upcoming version 0.5 changes.
		* thinkfan.c: New cmdline option -z to mark resuming as safe. Print
		message when resuming is considered unsafe.

		* In addition to the thinkpad-specific /proc/acpi/ibm interface,
		thinkfan now also supports the generic sysfs interface for reading
		temperatures and controlling fan speed.

		* thinkfan_system.c: Create file. Create sysfs interface and
		consolidate with IBM-specific interface.
		Use open() instead of fopen() because it's signal safe and
		causes no syscall noise.
		* thinkfan.h: Create file. Move all global definitions in
		here. Create macros for error- and informational output. Turn
		get_temp(), setfan() and init_fan() into function pointers.
		Extend tf_config structure to incorporate sysfs settings.
		* thinkfan.c: Lots of minor reorderings and cleanup. Use
		macros for all output. Move all sysfs-/IBM-specific functions
		into thinkfan_system.c.  Extend readconfig() for dealing with
		sysfs-specific settings. Clean up outer loop in run(),
		initialize signal handler earlier in main().  Correctly remove
		/var/run/thinkfan.pid on exit.

2009-03-20	Victor Mataré
		* thinkfan.c: Check for existing PID file upon startup, fix
		return value.

2009-02-25	Victor Mataré
		* thinkfan-0.4: Release 
		* README: Update to reflect 0.4 changes.
		* thinkfan.c: Correctly initialize return value.
		* thinkfan.example.conf: Update comments, use more
		conservative temperature limits, fix typo (thx clcl).
		* messages.c: Made things clearer.

2009-01-20	Victor Mataré
		* thinkfan.c: Add basic sanity checking on config, and a
		commandline switch to disable sanity checks. Improve error
		handling and logging behaviour in general, move all message
		strings into messages.c, make messages more meaningful.
		There has also been some minor code restructuring due to
		additional testing for error conditions and stability.
		* messages.c: Factor out all messages to make code more
		readable and messages more easily custimizable

2008-10-19	Victor Mataré
		* thinkfan.c: Correctly initialize config file name to make -c
		commandline option work. Thanks to clcl.
		* thinkfan-0.3.3: Bugfix release

2008-10-16	Victor Mataré
		* thinkfan.c: Fixed a bug not finding the highest temperature
		in the system if there are less than 16 entries in
		/proc/acpi/ibm/thermal.  Thanks to db for reporting.

2008-10-04	Victor Mataré
		* thinkfan-0.3.1: Release

		README), give fan control back to firmware on exit, use only
		the highest temperature instead of an average of 1st- and
		2nd-highest.
